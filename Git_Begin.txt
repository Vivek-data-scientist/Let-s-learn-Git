This is my first Git file ðŸ˜€

What is Git?
=============
Git is a kind of version control system, wherein it is one of the tool to save the history of your files.

Starting with Git:
==================
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
   depending on your system requirements, i.e, for Windows, Mac or Linux/Unix machines
2. Install Git in your system
3. Launch Git bash which is also called as Git command line
4. Check for git version to know whether git installation was successful or not by running below command

     git --version
  
   If it does not show any version, then there is some error in installation, you need to rectify that.

5. Configure your username and email by running below commands

     git config -global user.name "[name]"
     git config -global user.email "[email]"

   Please note provide your name and email inside []

6. Make a new directory in git bash command prompt using below command
     
     mkdir [directory_name]

   Please note provide own directory name inside []

7. Change to the new directory

     cd [directory_name]/

   Please provide the new directory name which you created in step 5

8. Create a file within this new directory using below command
     
     touch [filename].txt

   Please provide a file name suitable for you inside []. 
   Also note that you can create any file format, for simple understanding i have taken text file.

9. To verify file has been created, run below command
     
     ls

   It lists down all the files present in current working directory.

10. Now you can add content into this file as per your requirement directly by opening the file from file location
    (Or)
    By running below command and following subsequent steps content can be added using Git bash

      vim [filename].txt
      Press "I" or hit "insert" on keyboard
      Type in your content
      After you have completed adding the content, save the file, press Esc and then press :wq

11. To verify the contents of your file, navigate to the file in your folder path in local and open it.
    The file content will be visible.

12. Once file contents are changed, please head on next part of Git Learning series which is "Using Git for creating repos, stage the files and commit the files".

Happy Learning!!
